BOOZLE BLOG
===========

A private blogging platform created in order to privately share pictures and videos of my daughter with her grandparents. The grandparents love it.

About
-----

A Ruby on Rails blog engine with special emphasis on embedding You Tube videos and Picassa/Flickr images to remove necessity of hosting locally.

Incorporates tags and month by month archiving.

Uses Rails.js for AJAX comment adding.

Todos
-----

- Have an autofill drop down for the post's tags entry.
- Incorporate a light box for image viewing.

I would be more comfortable doing both of these in jQuery rather that Prototype thus they've been deferred until Rails 3.1 comes out. (Yes, I know I could use the [jQuery-Rails](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs) gem already.)
